# Maze - level 4

## Python lessons by Sergey Zobin <http://zobin.org>

### Tasks

1) To estimate which of the variants of the algorithm for choosing the direction for the player's figure on each move will lead to the target point of a simple maze with an obstacle in the form of a mob from task 3, solution 1, and how effective;
2) Write your own algorithm for choosing the direction for the player's figure and compare its effectiveness


### Simple solutions

- Solution 1: Move forwarg until wall and turn right
- Solution 2: Move forwarg until wall and turn left
- Solution 3: Move forwarg until wall and select random left or right turn
- Solution 4: Move along right wall
- Solution 5: Move along left wall
